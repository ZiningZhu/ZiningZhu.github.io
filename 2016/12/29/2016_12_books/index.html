        <p>My 2016 resolution included reading books, just like many people else. Excluding textbooks and those related to academia, I mainly read some books on these three fields in 2016:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Literature, music, art  </li>
<li>Cognitive psychology and academia  </li>
<li>Business  <span id="more"></span>
<h3 id="1-Literature-music-art"><a href="#1-Literature-music-art" class="headerlink" title="1. Literature, music, art"></a>1. Literature, music, art</h3><img src="/img/books2016/music_copland.jpg" alt=" "><br><strong>What To Listen For In Music</strong><br>4/5. It is interesting to look at perspective from professional composer: how they think about the important components of music.  </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/books2016/justice.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>Justice</strong><br>4/5. Skimmed through this book. It talks about the a few ethical paradigms that ESC203 and ESC301 of University of Toronto already talked about, so I didn’t take too much time on it.  </p>
<h3 id="2-Cognitive-psychology-and-academia"><a href="#2-Cognitive-psychology-and-academia" class="headerlink" title="2. Cognitive psychology and academia"></a>2. Cognitive psychology and academia</h3><p><img src="/img/books2016/memory_schacter.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>Searching For Memory: The Brain, The Mind, And The Past (Schacter)</strong><br>5/5. This is the first book introducing me to the field of memory and brain. It somewhat changed my way of recognizing how memories form and organize together.   Although this book covers a variety of solid knowledge, it is not boring to read through at all.<br>Several takeaways / ideas generated from this book:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Memories are initially fragments, and then either consolidated to solid engram structures or faded out;</li>
<li>How the engram structures work? Medial temporal region are indeces. The information there link to information at other places.</li>
<li>How memory structures consolidate? Sometimes via traumatic event, sometimes via brain damage (retrograde / anterograde amnesia), mostly via repetition. In this sense, if we say skills and knowledge are no different, and that they are both able to be reinforced. So our brains are actually von-Neumann-structured if an analogy is to be made to computer?</li>
<li>“Priming effect”: viewing can write information into the implicit memory.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/books2016/mind4numbers.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>A Mind For Numbers (Barbara Oakley)</strong><br>5/5. I sort of started reading this book in June, stopped for a while, and restarted in August. This book was read together with Schacter’s Searching For Memory and Mortimer’s How To Read A Book, and many of information in these books actually explains each other!<br>e.g: In A Mind for Numbers, Barbara talks about the diffused mindset of thinking. In Searching for Memory, this diffused mindset makes it easier for engrams to form structures, instead of the compact mindset prohibiting structures to be formed.<br>On the other hand, these books are not the same. A Mind for Numbers focuses on practical study methods guides on math-like subjects; How to Read a Book focuses on expository books, and Searching for Memory more about the cognitive foundations of reading and studying.<br>There are many practical suggestions, so it should be useful if you want a shortcut to improve marks. However, take practical suggestions with a grain of salt, as they may not apply equally successful to everyone. Ben Carson is an example. He ditched lectures and excelled in scores, which is definitely not going to be the case for most of us.</p>
<p><img src="/img/books2016/darktime.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>The Dark Time (Weipeng Liu)</strong><br>4/5. This book contains a lot of blogs of the author from MindHacks. A few categories worth noting down include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studying habits</li>
<li>Time management</li>
<li>Reading methods</li>
<li>Memorization. In this part the author uses his experience to talk about various techniques of reinforcing memory including teaching, abstraction, experience virtually, and relating to our experiences.</li>
<li>Critical thinking and problem solving<br>On the other hand, since this book is the blog of the author, it does not organize the information like a textbook. So I would not put this book as a “textbook” for any of the above-mentioned fields. There are plenty of books in each of these fields with better study paths.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/books2016/how2readabook.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>How To Read A Book (Mortimer J. Adler)</strong><br>5/5. This book puts together some techniques of understanding contents when reading a book. Mortimer classifies reading into four levels: elementary reading, inspectional reading, analytical reading, and syntopical reading (added in the new edition). Several takeaways from this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elementary reading is “I know what these words mean. If the material is simple enough I know what it talks about”.</li>
<li>Inspectional reading is the preface of analytical reading. There are two types of inspectional reading: systematic skimming and superficial reading. Systematic skimming goes to the title page, preface, index, table of contents, a few pages, and the last page. Superficial reading can be continued even though you do not fully understand.</li>
<li>Analytical reading involves pigeonholing (classifying) a book, coming to terms, determining the author’s message, raising criticisms towards the message or even the perspective of the author.</li>
<li>Syntopical reading involves a lot of translation between terms. Once the term is translated you are basically fine.</li>
<li>Reading is not purely about its information; a good book contains much more than its skeleton, which makes it interesting to read and approachable for readers. A reader should do his work to extract information skeleton from expository works.</li>
<li>A book should be read not faster than you can understand, and no slower than it deserves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The PhD Grind (Phillip Guo)</strong><br>5/5. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm">Online</a> This book exposes some unique aspects of the seemingly sacred academia world. PhD were regarded as the cleverest people, working on the frontier of human and contributing to the mysteristic task of “changing the world from the essential”. However, these are hallucinations. PhDs are dethroned from the hallucinations in this book.</p>
<ul>
<li>They need to do due diligence to contribute to the university.</li>
<li>They need to socialize and pitch everywhere to sell their ideas and find collaborators.</li>
<li>They care a lot about making their paper publish, just like how we students care about achieving high scores on exams, instead of focusing on the pure knowledge and technology.</li>
<li>They gossip about professors and comment on their ability of publishing paper, just as we students comment on how teachers lecture.</li>
<li>They take naps, hesitate, and even give up sometimes when encountering difficult problems just as we engineers do.</li>
<li>They are excited by interesting problems, and can continue working in full power when the paper publishing deadline is coming close, just as we do prior to exams or project deadlines.<br>He made PhDs look real and approachable — they are just normal people.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/books2016/codinginterview.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>Cracking The Coding Interview (Gayle Laakmann McDowell)</strong><br>5/5. I somewhat finished skimming through this book on the day before my first on-site interview in Silicon Valley and got an offer (writing Java as as summer intern in a 2000+ people software company). On one hand, this book is quite comprehensive: It talks about both technical and behavioral aspects of interview preparation. On the other hand, it talks a lot about Java, and for some problems have not the best solutions I can think of.<br>In comparison to the “Programming Interviews Exposed”, “Cracking the Coding Interview” has a lot more good practice problems, yet both of them give a good method to review knowledge in various fields a few days before programming interviews.  </p>
<p><strong>Blink</strong><br>2/5. This book tells good short stories, but its underlying logic skeletons can be clearer.<br>One of the things I find this book attractive is its short stories. It is always easier to enrich the reader’s storytelling database with books filled with handy stories, than with those serious books having clear logic skeletons and coherent ideas (but containing more theoretical babbling and less short interesting stories). After reading Blink, I can boast to friends the story of New Coke, surgeon-judgement, firefighter-instinct, marriage-judgement, Warren Hardin error, but that’s basically all of the takeaways. I expect to see more elaboration on its core idea, thin-slicing. Humans do thin-slicing and snap judgments; yes, but how? Thin-slicing can be sometimes misleading; yes, but when? Snap judgments can be manipulated; yes, but in which way? I would expect more comprehensive descriptions instead of storytelling as illustrations, in order to understand what is thin-slicing.<br>In chapter 1, the author introduces thin-slicing. This seem to be a powerful tool — but in following chapters, he describes a lot of examples about how thin-slicing doesn’t work. I expect to see a less biased “chapter 1”, mentioning (at least briefly) the limitations of thin-slicing. In that way, Blink can have more practical meanings to readers (we then can have an idea of when should we trust our instinct, instead of just telling stories).</p>
<p><img src="/img/books2016/nsca.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>NSCA’s Essentials of Personal Training</strong><br>4/5. Many people go to gyms, and personal trainers charge a lot of money, so why not get a certificate and teach myself? So I crammed this book and passed the NSCA’s CPT certification exam.<br>From the perspective of an amateur visitor of gym, this book actually gives many theoretical supports for planning training schedule, mastering training technique, and training healthily and safely. I took a mark off because it is a textbook, and is actually quite dry to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Business"><a href="#3-Business" class="headerlink" title="3. Business"></a>3. Business</h3><p><img src="/img/books2016/getting_more.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>Getting More (Stuart Diamond)</strong><br>4/5. There are a lot of stories about how to negotiate, which makes this book more interesting (instead of being filled with dry lectures). Especially the front half of the book is useful to look into. From my perspective, this book talks about a very important mind set: things are negotiable, and you got to get more out of it. With this mind set many of the reasoning in this book make sense.   With that being said, I feel the practical applications in the latter part are somewhat repetitive: just the same theory applied many times.  </p>
<p><img src="/img/books2016/sf2.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>Strength Finder 2.0</strong><br>4/5. An idea is interesting to note down: the most important skill is your strongest skill, not the weakest one. Of course the definition of importance if up to you and up to the situation, but Strength Finder puts forward a good perspective.  </p>
<p><strong>Conversational Speaking (A. Garner)</strong><br>3/5. A short pamphlet filled with guides on how to speak well. The examples are good, but it is always easier said than done. In reality, how to control the emotion and decide the most appropriate word to speak needs practice, experience and tons of stumbling.</p>
